# Bulletin Board Application

Create a website that allows people to post messages to a page. A message consists of a title and a body. The site should have two pages:

1. The first page shows people a form where they can add a new message.
2. The second page shows each of the messages people have posted. Make sure there's a way to navigate the site so users can access each page.

Messages must be stored in a postgres database. Create a "messages" table with three columns: column name / column data type:

id: serial primary key

title: text

body: text



## Additional Grading Criteria

As before, your package.json must include the correct dependencies.

Additionally, you must configure postgres as follows: Name your database "bulletinboard". Your postgres username must be read from an environment variable named "POSTGRES_USER". Your postgres password (if present) must be read from an environment variable named "POSTGRES_PASSWORD"
